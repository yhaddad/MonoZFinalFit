# ðŸš§ Final Fit code for the CMS MonoZ analysis (DEPRICATED) ðŸš§
Code used to extract limits of the CMS MonoZ analysis[^1].

Although this code is deprecated, some analyses still use it for signal extraction, such as [SUEPLimits](https://github.com/SUEPPhysics/SUEPLimits).
For most updated and upgraded functionalities, please refer to [DCTools](https://github.com/yhaddad/DCTools).
